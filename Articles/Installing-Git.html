            <ul>
              <li>A Linux distro</li>
              <li>Terminal access</li>

              <li>A github account and repository</li>
              <li>An internet connection</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="major">What is git?</h3>
            <p>
              Git is an extremely popular, free, open source, distributed
              version control system (DVCS). This means it will keep track of
              code being added, updated, or modified in any way. The Distributed
              part means that git can use every copy of the code as a repository
              to store the full history of the project. Even if all copies on
              every server, backup server, backup backup server are destroyed,
              if a developer is using git to work on it then it can be
              restored.<br /><br />However, git is not the only DVCS, so why is
              it so popular? Git has been actively maintained since 2005, where
              it was created by none other than Linus Torvalds, the creator of
              Linux himself. Git has been tried and tested for more than 15
              years, and it is one of the fastest, lightest and most documented
              programs of it's kind. Git is now a key part of so many sytems and
              development teams, even this website was written and deployed to
              my web server using git.
            </p>
            <h3 class="major">Seeing if we have git installed</h3>
            <p>
              Note: Returning back again? Have a look at the
              <a href="#cheatsheet">Cheatsheet</a><br /><br />
              Most decently sized desktop versions of linux already come with
              git pre-installed, as it is such a widely used program. You can
              check very simply by running the command:<br /><code
                >git --version</code
              ><br /><br />Which should hopefully return a message telling you
              your current version of git:<br /><code>git version 2.23.4</code
              ><br /><br />If this runs correctly you have git installed already
              and you can skip straight to
              <a href="#config">Configuring git</a>, but don't panic if you
              recieve an error saying "git: command not found", this just means
              you dont have git preinstalled and you need to simply install
              it...
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Installing Git on Linux</h3>
            <p>
              Installing any popular application is very straightforward on
              linux, through the use of a package manager. simply type or even
              copy and paste the command below that corresponds to your package
              manager or your distro into the terminal. <br /><br />For Ubuntu
              and Ubuntu based distributions:<br /><code
                >sudo apt install git</code
              ><br /><br />For Arch and Arch based distributions:<br /><code
                >sudo pacman -S git</code
              ><br /><br />For Gentoo and Gentoo based distributions:<br /><code
                >sudo emerge git</code
              ><br /><br />For Fedora and other Red Hat based distributions:<br /><code
                id="config"
                >sudo yum install git</code
              ><br /><br />Now run again the git --version command and you
              should see that git is successfully installed on your system. You
              can now configure it. Still unsure? Try googling what package
              manager your distro uses and how to install packages with it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Configuring Git</h3>
            <p>
              Now that we have git installed, we need to configure a few
              variables in order to get full use out of it. The main things we
              need to set the name and email Git will tie our commits to. Use
              these commands, replacing <em>Name</em> and <em>Email</em> with
              valid information that should would link to any github account you
              plan to use.<br /><br /><code
                >git config --global user.name “<em>Name</em>”</code
              ><br /><code>git config --global user.email "<em>Email</em>"</code
              ><br /><br />Optionally, we can also configure ssh keys for git
              and github, allowing for commits without a password. I have made
              an article on it <a>here</a> but we will skip it for this tutorial
              as it is not essential and is a more complex process for someone
              who is just starting out with git, so for now we will move on with
              learning how to use git
            </p>
            <h3 class="major">Understanding git</h3>
            <p>
              In order to use git, we need to understand more of how git works.
              There are a couple of terms you should know, as they are crucial
              to a proper understanding of git. Firstly, we have a
              <b>Repository</b>, commonly called a <b>Repo</b>. Think of this
              like a master folder in which all of your git enabled project
              should be stored. <br /><br />Next we have a <b>Branch</b>. This
              is like, well a branch off of your main project. All new
              repositories start with a Master/Main branch, and more can be
              created easily. Branches are used so we can organize code into for
              example: a stable branch that would be currently deployed, a Main
              branch where people working on the project can <b>commit</b> their
              newest changes, feature branches for new features and hotfix
              branches for quick bug fixes. Branches, and git in general are all
              about being more organized, making development easier, especially
              on a larger scale team.<br /><br />
              Pretty straightforward so far right? well now we understand how
              git organizes code, we need to learn how to 'upload' it. Firstly a
              file must be registered for commitment, then commited with a
              message describing what we have changed, then it can be pushed
              from our local repository to the remote one, like your github
              repository for example.<br /><br />For now this is all you need to
              know about git, time to Build our first repository
            </p>
            <h3 class="major">Creating our first repository</h3>
            <p>
              <i
                >Note: If you don't want to create your own repository, you can
                <a href="#clone">Clone an existing Repository</a></i
              ><br /><br />In order to create our first repository, we first
              need a directory for it, lets create one using this command:<br /><code
                >mkdir <em>myFirstRepository</em></code
              ><br /><br />Then we can then Change into this directory using:<br /><code
                >cd <em>myFirstRepository</em></code
              ><br /><br />Now we can finally use our first real git command:
              git init. this will initialize our repository, creating the .git
              directory and allowing us to use git with it.<br /><code
                >git init</code
              ><br /><br />Now lets create two basic files:<br /><code
                >touch <em>myFileOne</em></code
              ><br /><code>touch <em>myFileTwo</em></code
              ><br /><br />To 'register' these files for commitment we can use
              the commands:<br /><code>git add myFileOne</code><br /><code
                >git add myfileTwo</code
              ><br /><br />But seeing as we want to add all the files anyway we
              can use this command to add all modified files and directories to
              the commit list: <br /><code>git add -A</code><br /><br />Now to
              commit these files with a message describing what we have changed
              we can do:<br /><code>git commit -m "<em>Upload Files</em>"</code
              ><br /><br />Now our changes have been commited to our local
              repository on the main branch, but what if we want to commit it to
              a remote server like github to access anywhere? This is very
              simple, we just add the url of our github repo, then push our
              commits to it using the following two commands:<br /><code
                id="clone"
                >git remote add
                <em>myFirstRemoteRepo</em> https://github.com/<em
                  >username/repository</em
                ></code
              ><br /><code>git push <em>myFirstRemoteRepo</em></code
              ><br /><br />Well done, you have just created, modified and
              commited to your first repository, and commited it to a remote
              server. You have only a few more basic commands to learn and you
              will have fully mastered git!
            </p>
            <h3 class="major">Common Practices and additional commands</h3>
            <p>
              Although sometimes creating a local repo first is the only option,
              I personally always create new repositories on github first, and
              <b>clone</b> them to my computer. This is also how you would clone
              code to another machine that doesnt have any of the code
              downloaded.<br /><code
                >git clone https://github.com/<em
                  >username/repository</em
                ></code
              ><br /><br />If you have more than one developer working on a
              remote repository or have commited code on several different
              machines, you can have issues where code has been altered but is
              out of date, even if you are working alone, it is a best practise
              to pull from the remote repo before you push your new code.
              <br /><code>git pull <em>remoteName branch</em></code
              ><br /><br />If however, pushing still returns an error stating
              some refs could not be pushed to remote, then you may need to
              rebase the branch using:<br /><code
                >git pull --rebase <em>remoteName branch</em></code
              ><br /><br />To manage branches you can use the following three
              commands to list branches, create new branches, and switch to
              another branch.<br /><code id="cheatsheet">git branch</code
              ><br /><code>git branch <em>branchName</em></code
              ><br /><code>git checkout <em>branchName</em></code>
            </p>
            <h3 class="major">Git Command Cheatsheet</h3>
            <p>
              I don't know about you, but I love Cheatsheets. This section will
              probably see the most use out of me. Been on holiday for a week
              and forgot some commands? cheatsheet. Want to use that one obscure
              command you skipped reading up about? cheatsheet. been a long time
              gui user but dont know any git cli commands? cheatsheet! If you
              are here because you've read this entire page and are ready to
              start learning git, bookmark this page and you will learn every
              command just by visiting here each time you forget. Major credit
              to github for having such great documentation and accurate but

          <p>
            Got a question? Just message me. I respond to as many messages on
            all platforms as I can, but the best way to reach me is by email.
            Found a bug? shhhhh don't tell too many people, just create an issue
            on github or contact me if it's website breaking or a security risk.
          </p>
